# tabletop-pool
Tabletop pool simulator in GML, showing all scripts used as a demonstration of my coding style. Also contains the executable game file, so you can see it in action.

Controls for the white ball: Left/right arrows steer the aim, and holding the up arrow charges the shot; release at any time to fire with that much force. The N/M keys can be used for finer aiming.
